## How to Use — Just Ask

Say any of these to Claude and the skill activates:

> **"Create a chart showing..."**

> **"Visualise this data as a..."**

> **"Build me a network graph of..."**

> **"Make a dashboard comparing..."**

> **"I need a sankey diagram for..."**

### Worked Examples

**Relationships and connections:**
> "Create a network graph showing the relationships between these team members and their projects"

Produces a force-directed graph with interactive filtering, physics simulation, and hover details showing connection strength.

**Timelines and progression:**
> "Build an animated timeline of our product releases from 2023 to 2026"

Generates a horizontal timeline with phase markers, duration bars, and quote integration at key milestones.

**Multi-metric comparison:**
> "Make a dashboard comparing our five business units across revenue, headcount, and customer satisfaction"

Creates a multi-chart dashboard combining bar charts, radar polygons, and trend lines in a dark-themed layout.

**Data flow and allocation:**
> "Show me how our budget flows from departments to project categories as a sankey diagram"

Produces a flowing ribbon diagram with hover tooltips showing exact amounts and proportional widths.

**From raw data:**
> "Here's a CSV of survey results — turn it into something visual"

Analyses the data shape and recommends the best chart type, then generates it as a standalone HTML file.

**Presentation mode:**
> "I need a cinematic animated walkthrough of this knowledge graph for a board presentation"

Creates scene-based animation with particle effects, dramatic transitions, and narrative pacing.

**Quick comparison:**
> "Radar chart comparing these five products across price, quality, speed, support, and features"

Renders an interactive spider chart with hover values and category colouring.
